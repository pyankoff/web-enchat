      Last Updated: June 21, 2018

      Welcome to the Campfire, accessible via our mobile device application (the “App”). Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy carefully because they govern your use of our services and App. To make these Terms easier to read, our services and App are collectively called the “Services.”

      Agreement to Terms

      By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

      Changes to Terms or Services

      We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know by posting the modified Terms on the App. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

      Who May Use the Services

      Eligibility
      You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.

      Safety
      Though Campfire strives to encourage a respectful user experience, it is not responsible for the conduct of any user on or off of the Services. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. You should not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money, to other users.

      YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FLIPCHAT DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. FLIPCHAT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF USERS. FLIPCHAT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS.

      Registration and Your Information
      If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). You can do this via the App. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.

      Community Rules.

      Campfire reserves the right to investigate and/ or terminate your account without a refund of any purchases if you have misused the Service or behaved in a way that Campfire regards as inappropriate or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur off the Service but involve users you meet through the Service.

      10. Other Users’ Content.
      Although Campfire reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is the sole responsibility of the user who posts it, and Campfire cannot guarantee that all Content will comply with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Services that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Services or via contact@andychatbot.com.

      Feedback

      We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You can submit Feedback by emailing us at contact@andychatbot.com. You grant us a perpetual, free, and transferable license, with a right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any form and media and for any purpose.

      Privacy Policy

      When you register for a Campfire account, Campfire collects personal information such as your username, email address, birth date, gender, spoken and studied languages and any other personal or preference information that you enter into the Service, as well as your profile picture. Campfire will use your personal information for the following general purposes: (i) to provide you with Services; (ii) to respond to your questions and comments; (iii) to communicate with you via regular mail and email (or other electronic means) about the Service; for (iv) statistical purposes and (v) otherwise as described to you at the point of collection. When you use the Service, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, enrol in events and courses, and transmit information through various channels. Campfire stores and collects this information so that Campfire can provide you with the Service and offer personalised features. Campfire also receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the pages you request, whether or not you register for an account. Campfire uses such information to customise the advertising and Content you see, fulfil your requests for products and services, improve our Service, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal purposes and for external clients such as advertisers. If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. Campfire may attempt to send invitations more than once. Campfire stores this information to send such emails, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral programme. Your friend may contact us at contact@andychatbot.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

      Please note that if you enter payment details into the Service when purchasing a Paid Service (including any Premium Membership), Campfire itself does not receive or store such payment information, as such information is received, stored and used by our payment service providers for the purpose of completing the purchase. You can opt out of email communication initiated by Campfire including newsletters, email notifications and progress reports, in your Settings on the Site.

      General Terms

      These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Campfire and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Campfire and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

      You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Campfire's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Campfire may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Campfire. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
