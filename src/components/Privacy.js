      {`PRIVACY POLICY
    Campfire takes your privacy very seriously. Campfire is committed to safeguarding your privacy, and this privacy policy explains our data collection, use, and disclosure practices.

    This policy covers how Campfire treats personal information that Campfire collects and receives from you.

    Campfire provides its service (the "Service") to you subject to the Terms of Service, and the following Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted on the Site. You can review the most current version of the Privacy Policy at any time here www.Campfire.com/privacy. Your continued use of the Service or the Site after any such changes have been made constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

    Words beginning with capital letters in this Privacy Policy which are not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Service.

    1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

    When you register for a Campfire account, Campfire collects personal information such as your username, email address, birth date, gender, spoken and studied languages and any other personal or preference information that you enter into the Service, as well as your profile picture. Campfire will use your personal information for the following general purposes: (i) to provide you with Services; (ii) to respond to your questions and comments; (iii) to communicate with you via regular mail and email (or other electronic means) about the Service; for (iv) statistical purposes and (v) otherwise as described to you at the point of collection. When you use the Service, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, enrol in events and courses, and transmit information through various channels. Campfire stores and collects this information so that Campfire can provide you with the Service and offer personalised features. Campfire also receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the pages you request, whether or not you register for an account. Campfire uses such information to customise the advertising and Content you see, fulfil your requests for products and services, improve our Service, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal purposes and for external clients such as advertisers. If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. Campfire may attempt to send invitations more than once. Campfire stores this information to send such emails, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral programme. Your friend may contact us at contact@andychatbot.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

    Please note that if you enter payment details into the Service when purchasing a Paid Service (including any Premium Membership), Campfire itself does not receive or store such payment information, as such information is received, stored and used by our payment service providers for the purpose of completing the purchase. You can opt out of email communication initiated by Campfire including newsletters, email notifications and progress reports, in your Settings on the Site.

    2. STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

    We store your personal information only on secure servers that are held in secure facilities in the European Union and have up-to-date firewall protection. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored and/or processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will only retain your personal information for as long as we need to in order to fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise explicitly agreed with you.

    3. COOKIES

    A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your browser to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to use some features of the Service.

    You can find out more about how we use cookies on Campfire here: www.Campfire.com/cookies

    Campfire lets other entities that show advertisements or provide services on some of our web pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this policy. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Campfire's cookies.

    4. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

    We display your Profile information (except for your email address and password) to people browsing for friends, and to support other Site functions. Campfire does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with third parties except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or in the following circumstances:

    where Campfire is responding to a subpoena, court order, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend ourselves against legal claims;
    where Campfire believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Campfire's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law;
    where you are using a Paid Service (including a Premium Membership) in your capacity as a student or an employee or other third party using the Paid Service, we may in such circumstances share your personal information with your educational establishment, your employer or any third party paying for the Service on your behalf (as the case may be) to allow them to monitor your use of the Paid Service;
    where Campfire transfers information about you if Campfire is acquired by or merged with another company. If this happens, Campfire will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    Please remember that whenever you disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result.

    We may also disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, now and in the future).

    5. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

    Campfire displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the relevant targeting criteria (for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area). Campfire does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. We may also carry out targeted advertising to you on behalf of one or more third parties, but in doing so we will not share your email address or other personal information with such third parties.

    6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

    We shall take measures to protect personal data using reasonable and industry standard security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, improper use or modification.

    Your personal data is password protected and, other as set out in this Privacy Policy, can only be seen by you and us. You agree to keep your password(s) confidential and not to disclose them to anyone else, or allow them to be disclosed.

    Campfire limits access to personal information about you to employees who Campfire reasonably believes need to come into contact with that information, to provide products or the Service to you, or in order to do their jobs.

    Campfire has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with regulations to protect personal information about you. However, data transmissions over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, Campfire cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Campfire. In particular, by accessing and using the Service, you do so at your sole risk and you are responsible for restricting access to your computer and ensuring that your computer is free from all types of malicious code, spyware, viruses, Trojans, etc. that may track any data you enter into the Service, including e-mail address, and payment related information.  We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from the userâ€™s failure to comply with this paragraph.

    However, when you pay for a Paid Service, Campfire uses secure payment service providers to make sure that your payments are secure.

    7. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

    Where the Site, or any other part of the Service, links to other websites, such other websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. Campfire recommends that you examine the privacy statements posted on such other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
